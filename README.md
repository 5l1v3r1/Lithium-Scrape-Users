Lithium-Scrape-Users
====================

A simple python script to scrape all usernames from a Lithium Community based site.

a bit of leg work will be required to get the actual url of the users profile first, then an invalid and valid user titles.

let the number of thread finish else the output file has a shit-fit

Enjoy
